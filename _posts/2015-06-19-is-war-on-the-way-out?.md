Is war on the way out? Intuition tells us, no way, just watch the news and you'll hear about all kinds of horrific conflicts. But Joshua Goldstein and Steven Pinker say they looked at the numbers and found evidence that actually, globally there's a declining trend in violence and wars. What are their arguments, and do they make sense? A distinguished Harvard university panel comprising the authors, the international relations scholars Monica Toft and Stephen Walt, and hosted by Joseph Nye is discussing the inclination of human nature towards violence and the past, present, and possible future of organized armed conflict. Well worth watching.
